## Reflections

Over the course of the semester, our group worked together to build this app, working through challenges, and through both things that went well and things that didn't go so well. First, the things that didn't go well. When using the help of AI to debug, it often did not fully understand or really help with finding issues in our code. For most of us, this is our first time using React to build an app, and it would've been helpful for debugging. Second, there were some issues with version control and committing to the same repository. Sometimes, we ran into issues with somebody pushing before somebody else, and they worked on the same thing. Lastly, we had planned to implement a database, but we ended up not using it. We still spent time preparing it even though it wasn’t ultimately needed.

However, there were a lot of things that went well. First, we all came together and built a working app, despite not having much prior knowledge of building an app. Also, we worked well together to find bugs in the code. Whenever the app broke or one of us found something that was wrong, we all came together to search for what was going wrong, and we fixed those coding errors. Last, we used a lot of our own resources to build the app. For example, instead of searching for workout plans or workout videos, we built our own plans and recorded our own videos.
